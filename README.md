# 👋 Hi everyone, I'm Matteo!

I'm a self‑taught freelance developer with a genuine passion for technology, which started with my first experiments building forums and static websites.  
Today I create websites for individuals and businesses mainly with WordPress, while continuously working on my roadmap to become a full‑stack developer, expanding my skills in modern web technologies.
